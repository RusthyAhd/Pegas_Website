## 🎯 YOUR QUESTION

> "When someone searches 'pegas' on Google, I want 'www.pegas.lk' to appear in autocomplete suggestions with my favicon logo, just like 'apple.com' appears when typing 'apple'."

## 📝 THE ANSWER

**Short Answer:** Your website's technical SEO is now perfect. However, appearing in Google search autocomplete requires **6-12 months** of active marketing and brand building because:

1. **Google autocomplete = Brand recognition**, not just technical SEO
2. You need **thousands of people** searching for "pegas" every month
3. Your domain is new (2024) - needs time to build authority
4. You need significant **backlinks** and **social signals**

**What I've Done:** ✅ Fixed all technical requirements
**What You Must Do:** 🚀 Marketing, social media, and brand awareness (see action files)
